# Android-project (E-PANCHAYAT) :
This is an Android Application to connect rural people with their panchayat

– Tools & technologies used: XML, Java, Google Firebase

– This project is built as a part of my academic project. The main features of this Application go like User and PDO
authentication where users can post their complaints into the portal and because of the real-time database, the
complaints will be instantly reflected on the PDO module so that the panchayat can look into the matter quickly
and also user can view schemes and look into the basic details of panchayat members and contact them and PDO can 
update scheme data and add or delete members data as well and look into the complaints filed by the Users.
